    <h1>  For the first week of our immersion at AXA, 
        we were warmly welcomed by Miss Sherlyn Ylagan,
         along with the branch admin and other employees.
          They introduced us to the rules, tasks, and expected 
          responsibilities within the company. On the very first day,
           we were immediately given various duties, 
           including cleaning the office, assisting with client-related tasks,
            and maintaining order in the workplace.  </h1>

        The second week for experiences and responsibilities from the first. We continued with our tasks, such as cleaning the office, and welcoming clients, and following up on tasks from staff. The Canva project from last week was completed and was an important one for us. We were also asked to promote the company's hiring process by posting on various Facebook pages.

        One of our creative tasks this week, we were given a new projectâ€”creating a business card design using Canva. Although it was a challenge for us, the process was fun and exciting as we had the opportunity to showcase our design skills.
